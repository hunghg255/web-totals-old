So, what are build tools, exactly? Well, they're a set of tools that help you automate repetitive tasks, optimize your code, and improve your workflow. There are three main categories of build tools: <b>task runners</b>, <b>bundlers</b>, and <b>compilers</b>.

Task runners are tools that automate repetitive tasks such as testing, linting, and minifying code. Bundlers allow developers to bundle multiple files into one file, reducing load times and improving performance. Compilers enable developers to write code in one language and compile it into another, such as using TypeScript to write JavaScript code.

Using build tools has several benefits to improve the development workflow, including reducing development time, improving code quality, and streamlining the deployment process.

By automating repetitive tasks, optimizing code, and providing real-time feedback on errors and code quality, build tools help improve the overall developer experience and make development less stressful.

Let's look at the currently most popular build tools that front-end developers are using:
